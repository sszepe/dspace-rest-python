# DSpace Python REST Client Library

This client library allows Python 3 scripts (Python 2 probably compatible but not officially supported) to interact with
DSpace 7+ repositories, using the DSpace REST API.

This library is a work in progress and so far offers basic create, update, retrieve functionality for
Community, Collection, Bundle, Item, Bitstream, Group and User (EPerson) objects.

Help with extending the scope and improving the code is always welcome!

PyPI homepage: https://pypi.org/project/dspace-rest-client/

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (developed using Python 3.8.5)
- Python Requests module (see `requirements.txt`)
- Working DSpace 7 repository with an accessible REST API

## Installation

To install with pip:
`pip install dspace_rest_client`

(or `pip3` or `python -m pip` as appropriate to your environment)

To install manually, clone this repository and install the requirements:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/the-library-code/dspace-rest-python.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing dependencies, you're ready to run the script.
You can either pass the base API URL to the DSpaceClient() constructor or set them as environment variables.

Some environment variables can be used when setting up the REST client connection.
`DSPACE_API_ENDPOINT` is the base URL of your endpoint eg. http://localhost:8080/server
`DSPACE_API_USERNAME` and `DSPACE_API_PASSWORD` are credentials to use for authentication.

See the `example.py` script for an example of community, collection, item, bundle and bitstream creation.
Just set the credentials and base URL at the top of the script to match your test system, or if you've set environment
variables, remove the arguments from the DSpaceClient() instantiation and the environment variables will be used as
defaults.

The output from the `example.py` script should look something like:

```commandline
╰─$ python example.py                                                                                                                                                                                                              1 ↵
